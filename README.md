# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this excercise was to gain an understanding of the basics of Python as well as gain familiarity navigating the command line. In this particular analysis, we helped an employee of an election campaign run basic calculations to determine campaign results. More specifically, we helped this employee tally votes by candidate and county, as well as the proportion of votes by candidate and county, to compare results.

## Election-Audit Summary

The overall analysis and thought process of this excersise, with some modifications, can be applied to any election. There might be some variations in the input data such as file type, number of fields, what the fields are etc.. but the method is the same. Every election will at some point need to summarize votes and analyze the different factors that constributed to a campaigns success or failure. The analysis and comparison of votes and the various elements of those votes are what gives a campaign insight into its voter base. Without the analysis, all you have is meaningless data.

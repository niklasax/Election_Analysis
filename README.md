# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this excercise was to gain an understanding of the basics of Python as well as gain familiarity navigating the command line. In this particular analysis, we helped an employee of an election campaign run basic calculations to determine campaign results. More specifically, we helped this employee tally votes by candidate and county, as well as the proportion of votes by candidate and county, to compare results.
